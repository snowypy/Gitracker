## Setting up Git Tracker:

## As of v1.1.0 we now use GitHub Actions!

> [!NOTE]
> You can deploy Gitracker [Here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-via-gitracker)
> You will need to set up one secret in your repository settings, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`. To do so, go to your repository settings, then secrets, then new repository secret. Name it `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and paste your webhook URL in the value box.
